This project is a frankensteins monster of experimenting with concepts, and testing ideas. Some of them for the purposes of learning, some for the purpose of working out how to implement a new feature in an app I work on for work. 

I should have separated them out into different branches. But I didn't and now we're here and I'm going to live with it. I want to see where it goes. In a future experiment I'll try to structure it better. And document it. But lets just let this chaos grow.

Some experiments included in this project:
- FRONTEND
  -- Storybook
  -- Viteest
  -- Tailwind 4
  -- Component structure*
  -- Tanstack Router
- BACKEND
  -- FastEndpoints
  -- Microservice architecture / Event driven architecture

*Component structure
I am separating components out far more than is reasonable for an app of this size - an experiment in keeping hooks and logic seperate from stupid presentational components. For testing and tidiness. I also wanted to create more structure in how presentational components are created. Using a simplified version of atomic design to break them down and support the creation of composable and reusable components and improve manageability.

None of these experiements are 'complete'. Unforunately I tend to get an experiment so far, then when I have worked out how it can be applied to my job I take the learning over there.
